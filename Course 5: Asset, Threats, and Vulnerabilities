Safeguarding Information

Moduel 1: Understanding Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities


Asset – Anything valuable that needs protection (e.g., data, hardware, software).
Threat – A potential danger to an asset (e.g., hackers, malware, insider threats).
Vulnerability – A weakness that can be exploited (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords).

Data goveranance
Data owner: the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.
Data custodian: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.
Data steward: the person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization.PII is any information used to infer an individual's identity. Personally identifiable information, or PII, refers to information that can be used to contact or locate someone.

PII (personaly Indetificable Information_: anything used to contact you
PHI (protected health information):  HIPAA
SPII (Sensitive PII) bank account, login, SNN
 > may be needed at specific moments: should be recorded when, why and who

Information privacy refers to the protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
Information security (InfoSec) refers to the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

Module 2: Encryption

Encryption: the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format
Public key infrastructure (PKI): an encryption framework that secures the exchange of online information
Cipher: an algorithm that encrypts information

Symmetric encryption is the use of a single secret key to exchange information. 
  Because it uses one key for encryption and decryption, the sender and receiver must know the secret key to lock or unlock the cipher.
  - requires a secure way to share the key between sender and receiver
  - faster and efficient for large amounts of data
 > Triple DES (3DES): applies DES encryption x3 for enhances security (168 bit key)
 > AES (Advanced Encryption Standards) uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys

Asymmetric encryption is the use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data. 
  Public key is used to encrypt data, and the private key decrypts it. 
  CA (Certificare Authority) issues digital certificates, which verify the identity of a user or website and contain the public key
  private key is securely generated and stored by the recipient.
  > RSA

🔹 Public Key (🔓) → Open, shared freely, only encrypts data
🔹 Private Key (🔑) → Secret, stays with the bank, only decrypts data (never sent over the internet)

> Symmetric encryption: The encryption key must be shared between sender and receiver
    An attacker could intercepts the key during transmission and can decrypt everything
[
1️⃣ Browser requests a secure connection (https://)
2️⃣ Server sends RSA public key (verified by a CA)
3️⃣ Browser generates a random AES key
4️⃣ AES key is encrypted using RSA public key
5️⃣ Encrypted AES key is sent to the server
6️⃣ Server decrypts AES key with its RSA private key]
-
Generating keys
These algorithms must be implemented when an organization chooses one to protect their data. 
OpenSSL is an open-source command-line tool. It generates public & private keys for encryption.
Also used to verify digital certificates in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

Obscurity is not security: A strong algorithm should remain secure even if its details are public—only the private key must be secret.
-
keys are vulnerable to getting lost and stolen

Hash function: One-way encryption that produces a fixed-size hash value; cannot be decrypted.
 Even a small change in input produces a completely different hash, making it ideal for data integrity checks.
 Each input is then first hashed then Hash values are compared (which can be quickly done by computers)
accomplished authentication and non-repudiation (information authenticity cannot be denied)


Hash Collisions
Hash collisions: Occur when different inputs produce the same hash value, posing a security risk (e.g., impersonation).
  Hash algorithms map any input, regardless of its length, into a fixed-size value of letters and numbers since there’s only a finite set of available outputs!
> Because hashes are used for authentication, a hash collision is similar to copying someone’s identity. 
>> Attackers can carry out collision attacks to fraudulently impersonate authentic data.

longer hashes is more secure: SHA (Secure Hashing Alogrithm) family
Numbers besides each SHA function indicate the size of its hash value in bits. Except for SHA-1, which produces a 160-bit digest (NIST approved)
Five functions make up the SHA family of algorithms:

SHA-1
SHA-224
SHA-256
SHA-384
SHA-512

Secure password storage: Passwords are hashed and stored; comparison is done with the hashed value to verify authenticity.
These are secured even if the data base is compromised due to hashing

Rainbow tables
A rainbow table is a file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext. 
Hackers use them

Salting is an additional safeguard that's used to strengthen hash functions. 
A salt is a random string of characters that's added to data before it's hashed. The additional characters produce a more unique hash value, making salted data resilient to rainbow table attacks.

Module 2: Authentication, Authorization, And Accounting

Managing who or what has access to information
Access Control: Security controls that manage who can access what, ensuring:
✔️ Confidentiality – Protecting sensitive information.
✔️ Integrity – Preventing unauthorized modifications.
✔️ Availability – Ensuring users can access what they need.

It is broken down by the AAA framework (authentication, authorization, accounting)
Authentication → Who are you? (Verifying identity)
Authorization → What can you access? (Permissions)
Accounting → What did you do? (Logging & tracking)

-
Authentication
SSO 
A technology that combines multiple logins into one, allowing users to access several applications with a single authentication process.
✔️ Better User Experience: No need to remember multiple passwords.
✔️ Stronger Security: Reduces attack surfaces by centralizing authentication.
✔️ Cost Efficiency: Simplifies IT management & lowers password reset costs.
✔️ Prevents Password Fatigue: Users don’t reuse weak passwords across multiple sites.

Security Features of SSO
✔️ Centralized Authentication: Only one secure login instead of many weak passwords.
✔️ Reduces Phishing Risks: Users log in less often, reducing the chance of falling for fake login pages.
✔️ Uses Secure Tokens Instead of Passwords: Applications don’t store passwords—only trust temporary tokens issued by the IdP.
✔️ Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Can add extra layers (e.g., SMS codes, biometrics, security keys).

How SSO Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ User Requests Access
You enter credentials (username & password) on a site (e.g., Gmail).
Instead of Gmail verifying them, it redirects you to an Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Google’s authentication system).
2️⃣ Identity Provider Verifies Your Identity
IdP checks your credentials & confirms who you are.
If correct, the IdP issues an encrypted token containing your authentication details.
3️⃣ Token Sent to the Service Provider (SP)
Gmail (the Service Provider) receives this secure token from the IdP.
Instead of storing or handling your password, Gmail trusts the IdP’s verification.
4️⃣ Access Granted Across Services
Now, when you visit Google Drive or YouTube, they reuse the existing token instead of asking for a password again.

Limitations of SSO & How to Mitigate Risks
❌ Single Point of Failure: If an attacker gets your SSO password, they can access everything.
✔️ Solution: Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add another layer of security.

❌ Remote Access Risks: Cloud-based SSO can be harder to secure for remote users.
✔️ Solution: Implement Zero Trust Security (always verify, never assume trust).


-
Authorization
Linked to two security princples:
Least privledge: access only last as long as needed
Seperation of duties: principle that users shuold not be given level of authrization that would allow them to misuse a systems

Continuing on SSO, authorization over web pages is controlled by auth protocols
HTTP uses basic auth
 technology used to establish a use's request to acess a server
 sends an identifier every time a user commuincates with a web page
 > transmit username and passwords openly so is vulnerable
HTTPS uses O Auth
 Open standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between application
 > uses API token to verify access between you and the service provider rather than passwords
     Tokens Replace Passwords
     Tokens Expire & Can Be Revoked
     Tokens Are Limited in Scope (oyu can read these files but can't delete them)
-
Auditing
Monitoring the access logs of systems
- who accessed the system
- when they accessed the system
- what resources they used
> identify trends and uncover malicious activity, finding data breach

User Access System
 Session Creation: When a user logs in, a sequence of authentication requests and responses is triggered, capturing the moment the user enters and exits the system.
Session Cookie:
 A temporary data file stored in the browser.
 Contains a session ID—a unique token that tracks your login session on a website.
Session ID:
 The unique token that identifies the user and their device during the session.
 Helps prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive data by maintaining the user's session securely.
Session Hijacking:
A type of attack where an attacker can impersonate the user by stealing and using the session token.
-
IAM (identify Access Managment): collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. 
similar to AAA as it is designed to authenticate users, determine their access privileges, and track their activities within a system.


right user is granted access to the right resources at the right time and for the right reasons
Each of those four factors is determined by your organization's policies and processes.

authentication needs
User provisioning is the process of creating and maintaining a user's digital identity. 
Security analysts are routinely involved with provisioning users and their access privileges.

Granting authorization
If the right user has been authenticated, the network should ensure the right resources are made available. There are three common frameworks that organizations use to handle this step of IAM:

Mandatory access control (MAC)

Discretionary access control (DAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC)
