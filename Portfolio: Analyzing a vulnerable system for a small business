Scenario:
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. 
The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. 
Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. 
The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. 
As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

Vulnerability Assessment Report
5th February 2025

System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. 
It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. 
It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. 
Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. 
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from November 2025 to Febraury 2025. 
NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

Purpose
Exposing a data server to the public represents a critical vulnerability. 
Given the high likelihood and potential damage from a successful attack, 
the exposure could lead to significant financial losses, loss of customer trust, and severe reputational damage.
The database contains sensitive business information, which is pivotal to revenue generation. 
Consequently, securing this database is paramount to maintaining the integrity and success of the business.

Legend:
Likelihood Scale: 1 (Low) - 3 (High)
Severity Scale: 1 (Low) - 3 (High)
Risk: Likelihood x Severity

Approach
The risks were assessed by analyzing the data storage and management methods utilized by the business. 
The threat events were scaled based on their likelihood and severity, considering their potential impact on day-to-day operations. 
The likelihood of occurrence and the severity of impact were evaluated in relation to the operational requirements of the organization.

Remeditation Strategy:
To mitigate the identified risks, the following remediation strategy is proposed:
Implementation of AAA Framework (Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing):
  - Authentication: Enhance security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to confirm the identity of users and prevent unauthorized access.
  - Authorization: Employ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that individuals only have access to data relevant to their responsibilities.
  - Auditing: Regularly monitor and log access activities to the database to track who is accessing the data, when, and for what purpose. 
This will facilitate the identification of any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.

IP Allow Listing for Firewalls:
  Restrict access to the database by allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses, thereby reducing the potential attack surface from unauthorized network sources.
Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:
  Maintain ongoing surveillance of the database and its access logs to promptly detect and respond to any potential security incidents.
By implementing these measures, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the critical data and ensuring business continuity.
